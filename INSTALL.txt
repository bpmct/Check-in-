Hi,

Thank you for using my check in PHP script. Sadly it doesn't automatically work when uploaded. Follow these steps to get it working:

1. Create a MySQL database for the check in script

2. Import the tables using the .sql file included. (database.sql) You can use phpMyAdmin to do this.

3. Configure the database info and name of the script in config.php

4. You're done!
